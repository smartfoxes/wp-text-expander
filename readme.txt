WP Text Expander, manage snippents of text across the website from the central location.

== Description ==

#### WP Text Expander

*Allowing your WordPress administrator to create a shortcodes for frequently used text snippets and manage those from the central location without need to search and replace texts through your website.*

Do you have some info like date, price or product name which needs to be displayed in a few different places on your WordPress website?

When you need to change any of those, it may take some time to find all places where you put that info and update it everywhere. Plus, there is always a chance that you missed a spot or two.

WP Text Expander plugin allows you to replace common pieces of text in your posts, pages, menus, sidebar widgets with a custom shortcode and then update actual text from one central location in WordPress admin.

Once installed and activated, WP Text Expander creates a page in WordPress admin where you can add your custom terms and setup a text which will be displayed on your website. Text may be a short entry like a price, or it can be full length paragraph containing HTML markup.

After you have your terms setup, you can use a simple shortcode [mytext YOURTERM] in your posts, pages, widgets and even menus.

Your shortcodes will be replaced with centrally stored replacements, which makes it super-easy to update all entries from just one central spot, saving your time and making sure you haven't missed a spot.
